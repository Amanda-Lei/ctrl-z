      <p>According to the founding executive director of Fashion Taker Action, Kelley Drennan, we consume 400 percent more clothing today versus 20 years ago (Global News). <br>
        <br>
        “Is it democratic to buy a t-shirt for $5 and a pair of jeans for $30? Or are they (fast fashion brands) taking us for a ride? Because they are making us believe that we are rich and wealthy because we can buy a lot, but in fact, they’re making us poorer, and the only person who is becoming richer is the owner of the fast fashion brand.” - Livia Firth, 2014 at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit (Student Newspaper).

        <h2 class="impactHead">Labor</h2>
        <p>Sweatshops, more often than not,  facilitate physical abuse, sexual harassment, poor working conditions, and forced labor. <br>
          <br>
          Fast fashion trends are demanding workers to work overtime with smaller pay (Green America). <br>
          <br>
          Women make up 85 to 90 percent of workers in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka with the belief that women are more obedient to work long hours for little pay (Re/make Green America). <br>
          <br>
          Fast fashion targets are too demanding: trends lead to workers working overtime with little pay. <br>
          <br>
          Short-term contracts: this temporary work status allows suppliers to easily hire and fire workers to adjust to production fluctuations -- since the threat of termination is constant, workers are less likely to report an instance of workplace abuse (Green America). <br>
          <br>
          Only two percent of companies source their workers from suppliers that pay a living wage (Kinder).

        <h2 class="impactHead">Environmentally Friendly</h2>
        <p>Almost 40 percent of clothes in our closets are rarely or never worn (Kinder). <br>
          <br>
          According to the Institute of Sustainable Communication, the clothing industry is the world’s second-largest water polluter (Kinder). <br>
          <br>
          Each year clothing that ends up in NYC’s landfill sites can fill the Statue of Liberty with garments 440 times (Re/make). <br>
          <br>
          One garbage truck of clothing and textiles is sent to a landfill or burned every second (PowerOverEnergy). <br>
          <br>
          One percent of clothing is recycled into new clothing (PowerOverEnergy). <br>
          <br>
          Clothing and textile production releases 1.2 billion tons of greenhouse gases every year -- that’s more than the combined emissions for all international flights and shipping (PowerOverEnergy). <br>
          <br>
          The fashion industry uses 1,600 chemicals in their dyeing process, only one percent of which have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (Global News). <br>
