    <div class="intro">
      <p>Sustainable fashion is about meeting today’s needs while ensuring that the way we go about meeting those needs meets future needs, as well. Sustainable fashion is about benefiting the people involved throughout the fashion supply chain, from farmers to consumers to everyone working in end-of-life facilities, such as recycling. Consumers should not only pay attention to the quality of their garments, but also the entire supply chain, production processes, and product afterlife. <br><br> “Sustainability is not just about using bamboo based fibers and slapping the term ‘sustainable’ on the hangtag.  True sustainability comes when the entire supply chain of that bamboo is sustainable -- we have to understand that a supply chain is its own ecosystem that must be sustained and supported indefinitely in order for the world to see its environmental impact. We must design, develop, and manufacture into that premise.” - Melissa Nataadinigrat)</p>

        <h2 class="impactHead">Labor</h2>
        <p>Sweatshops, more often than not,  facilitate physical abuse, sexual harassment, poor working conditions, and forced labor. <br>
          <br>
          Fast fashion trends are demanding workers to work overtime with smaller pay (Green America). <br>
          <br>
          Women make up 85 to 90 percent of workers in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka with the belief that women are more obedient to work long hours for little pay (Re/make Green America). <br>
          <br>
          Fast fashion targets are too demanding: trends lead to workers working overtime with little pay. <br>
          <br>
          Short-term contracts: this temporary work status allows suppliers to easily hire and fire workers to adjust to production fluctuations -- since the threat of termination is constant, workers are less likely to report an instance of workplace abuse (Green America). <br>
          <br>
          Only two percent of companies source their workers from suppliers that pay a living wage (Kinder). <br>
          <br>
          Child labor is still very much prevalent in garment production. <br>
          <br>

        <h2 class="impactHead">Environmentally Friendly</h2>
        <p>Almost 40 percent of clothes in our closets are rarely or never worn (Kinder). <br>
          <br>
          According to the Institute of Sustainable Communication, the clothing industry is the world’s second-largest water polluter (Kinder). <br>
          <br>
          Each year clothing that ends up in NYC’s landfill sites can fill the Statue of Liberty with garments 440 times (Re/make). <br>
          <br>
          One garbage truck of clothing and textiles is sent to a landfill or burned every second (PowerOverEnergy). <br>
          <br>
          One percent of clothing is recycled into new clothing (PowerOverEnergy). <br>
          <br>
          Clothing and textile production releases 1.2 billion tons of greenhouse gases every year -- that’s more than the combined emissions for all international flights and shipping (PowerOverEnergy). <br>
          <br>
          The fashion industry uses 1,600 chemicals in their dyeing process, only one percent of which have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (Global News). <br>
          <br>
          UNECE shows that the fashion industry is the second-highest user of water worldwide and produces 20% of global water waste. <br>
          <br>
          It takes approximately 450 liters of water to make one T-shirt -- that’s more than 2 years of drinking water for one person (International Cotton Advisory Committee). <br>
          <br>
          Second-hand clothing not sold in the U.S. market is compressed into one-thousand-pound bales and exported overseas to be “graded'': (sorted, categorized, and re-baled) by low-wage workers in LMICs and sold in second-hand markets -- clothing not sold in markets become solid waste, clogging rivers, greenways, and parks, creating the potential for additional environmental health hazards in LMICs that lack waste systems. <br>

      <p>The new technology that can recycle fibers is being developed, but none of them are commercially viable yet -- there are processes that are being trialed where fibers can be broken down to their original chemical components and then respun into different fibers (minimal reliance on virgin fibers). <br>
        <br>
        Development of new materials, like leather made from grape skins and orange peels, which means leather can grow in a laboratory rather than relying on animals. <br>
        <br>
        In 2018, London Fashion Week prohibited designers using animal fur on its catwalks following pledges by brands such as Burberry, Gucci, and Versace to go fur-free. <br>

        <h2 class="impactHead">Price</h2>
        <p>How might having higher scores in the other sections affect the price? Vegan/environmentally friendly materials more expensive? Is it worth it? <br>
          <br>
          Up-front costs are high when converting a business to sustainable alternatives (PBS). <br>
          <br>
          Consuming less can reduce profits -- encouraging customers to buy less results in less profit, which is why fast-fashion giants gravitate towards mass consumerism(buying and selling as much product as possible as quickly as possible). <br>
          <br>
          Nobody wants to take accountability for the bills and price of sustainability. People aren’t willing to contribute to the cause, not yet at least (Yale Insights). <br>
          <br>
          The United Nations Council for African Renewal released a report in 2018 citing that “Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda are raising taxes on second hand clothes imports, and at the same time, offering incentives to local manufacturers. <br>

        <p>According to the founding executive director of Fashion Taker Action, Kelley Drennan, we consume 400 percent more clothing today versus 20 years ago (Global News). <br>
          <br>
          “Is it democratic to buy a t-shirt for $5 and a pair of jeans for $30? Or are they (fast fashion brands) taking us for a ride? Because they are making us believe that we are rich and wealthy because we can buy a lot, but in fact, they’re making us poorer, and the only person who is becoming richer is the owner of the fast fashion brand.” - Livia Firth, 2014 at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit (Student Newspaper). <br>
