        <p>Because companies donâ€™t broadcast information about their products and (un)ethical practices, consumers lack access to convenient data that could aid them in choosing the best companies from which to purchase goods. Specifically, in the clothing industry, fast fashion has generated an unhealthy trend of quantity over quality, negatively impacting the environment and people in low to middle income countries.</p>
        <p>We provide a way for consumers to make ethical choices when choosing clothing brands. Companies varying from very unethical to very ethical are shown on the map. Customers can then look through the ratings and decide what company sounds best to them.</p>
